## Bison-examples

This repository mainly contains bison syntax description files for several programming languages. Of course, since these languages ​​are not strictly context-free languages ​​in real situations, they ​​cannot be fully represented by context-free grammars. So the language that these compilers can handle is actually a variant.

But the advantage of using the bison description file is that it provides a way to describe the language in a very similar way to BNF. These descriptions give us a deeper understanding of the lexical and grammatical rules of the corresponding language.
